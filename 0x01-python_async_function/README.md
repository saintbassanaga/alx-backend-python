# Resources
## Read or watch:

- Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough
- asyncio - Asynchronous I/O
- random.uniform
# Learning Objectives
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module
# Requirements
## General
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
